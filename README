This is the Multi Repository Build System (mrb).

the PROJECT environmental varialbe must be set
You must also "setup $PROJECT <version> <qualifiers>" before running mrb

case 1:
mkdir <some working directory>
cd  <some working directory>
mrb newDev
-- will create build, localProductsXXX, and srcs subdirectories HERE

case 2:
mkdir <some code directory>
cd <some code directory>
mrb newDev -T <some working directory>
-- will create srcs subdirectory HERE
-- will create <some working directory>/build and <some working directory>/localProductsXXX

localProductsXXX will be of the form localProducts_project_version_qualifiers,
e.g. localProducts_larsoft_v0_00_01_debug_e2
